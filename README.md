# Hi!

## This is my submission for the Atlantis backend challenge.

### Installation and Usage

- These codes are run on a **virtual environment**, hence it's recommended to use one.
- The `requirements.txt` file contains all of the packages required to run these programs, so a quick `pip install -r requirements.txt` should be
enough.
- Then, every individual program contains it's own driver code/main method with certain inputs commented out, and suggestions provided.

### Performance metrics and enhancements

- `lxml` is used instead of the common `html.parser` for better running and performance.
- User validation is done whenever possible, with the aim of helping the end-user.
- Wherever possible, more print/console statements have been added for greater understanding and visibility.
- Code has been commented heavily for reference, with further tweaks/techniques mentioned (like in `pronounciable.py` where I tried to come up
with a coherent set of 'rules' for judging whether a word is pronounciable or not)
